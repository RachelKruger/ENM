***** Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM) Pipeline for Diplacus calycinus and Diplacus longiflorus *****
Rachel Kruger - 2024

This R Project contains the files and R code I used to go through the process of creating an ENM for D. longiflorus and D. calycinus. Everything was done in R except for the actual ENM creation, which was done using MaxEnt

Steps for conducting an ENM and associated files/scripts

1. Acquisition of Occurrence Data
2. Cleaning of Occurrence Data
	- R package *spThin*
